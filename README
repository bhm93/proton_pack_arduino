Hi Martinux, I´m Alberto and I´m from Spain. Actually I´m building a proton pack, and I´m using your electronic with arduino. 

I found your scheme in http://www.gbfans.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=22758&start=30 but I think is incomplete because I can´t see the adafruit part.

Can you sendme the scheme with sound part??? My email is alberto.klinker@gmail.com

Thank you. And sorry for my english.

Alberto.
